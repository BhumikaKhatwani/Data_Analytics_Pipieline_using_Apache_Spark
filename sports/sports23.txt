AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersBillionaire Ben Navarro, one of four known bidders for the Carolina Panthers, reached out to NFL legend Peyton Manning about joining his ownership group, according to a report from the Charlotte Observer.Manning is mulling Navarro's offer to become a limited partner, according to the report. The 42-year-old former quarterback's future has been a subject of interest this offseason, as he reportedly turned down Fox's offer to be the network's game analyst for "Thursday Night Football."Manning was also courted by ESPN for their "Monday Night Football" opening, which has since gone to former Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, but the five-time NFL MVP is believed to be more interested in an opportunity involving ownership or working in the front office of an NFL team than a TV job.Manning is estimated to have retired from the NFL with $400 million in total earnings, including endorsements, according to Forbes.Navarro, from Charleston, S.C., and CEO of Sherman Financial Group, is said to be the leading bidder for the Panthers at $2.6 billion, according to the New York Times. The other bidders include hedge fund manager and Pittsburgh Steelers part-owner David Tepper, Canadian steel company CEO Alan Kestenbaum and e-commerce entrepreneur Michael Rubin.The Observer reported last month that a vote to approve the sale of the Panthers could take place during league meetings May 21-23.Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, 81, announced in December he was selling the team he brought into the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1995. His decision came in the aftermath of a Sports Illustrated story alleging workplace sexual and racial misconduct.--Field Level MediaAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
