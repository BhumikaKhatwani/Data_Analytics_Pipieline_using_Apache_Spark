Martha Karolyi told "Dateline NBC" last month that Nassar conned her and her husband in much the same way he conned the parents and coaches of the girls he abused.The Texas Rangers are investigating, but the gymnasts say Texas hasn't executed search warrants or secured indictments, as some statutes of limitation loom.Olympic bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, who says Nassar molested her at the ranch, said: "I can't understand why this is not taken seriously in Texas."AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
