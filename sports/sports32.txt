"So we expect to lose about one-and-a-half seconds maybe.""But it’s a bit difficult to predict exactly the amount of development the teams will put on."The FIA this month announced modifications to front and rear wings and front brake ducts for next season to make it easier for cars to follow each other and increase overtaking.The measures followed research carried out by most teams and backed by commercial rights holders Liberty Media.
