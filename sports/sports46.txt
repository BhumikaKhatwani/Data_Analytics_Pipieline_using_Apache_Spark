"There was a little bit of a gap, so I took the chance."I said to him (Chaves) as soon as I caught him that he could take the stage. He deserved it."Groupama-FDJ rider Thibaut Pinot finished third, 26 seconds behind the leading duo in the same group as reigning champion Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb), Tour de France champion Chris Froome and UAE Team Emirates rider Fabio Aru.Dumoulin is 16 seconds adrift of Yates in second place overall while Froome, who has been off the pace at times so far, is one minute 10 seconds back.Chaves is third overall, 26 seconds back, ahead of Friday's mainly flat 159km stage.
