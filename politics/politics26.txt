Several of the plaintiffs are Muslim or minorities.Generally in the United States, law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant before it can search an American's electronic devices.But a so-called border search exception allows federal authorities to conduct searches within 100 miles (160 km) of a U.S. border without a warrant.
