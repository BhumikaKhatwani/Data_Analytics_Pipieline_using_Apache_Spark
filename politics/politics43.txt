"Their release should not be exalted, it should be expected. It is no great accomplishment of Kim Jong Un to do this." Schumer said Trump must seek strong, verifiable commitments from North Korea to disarm. "I worry that this president, in his eagerness to strike a deal, and get the acclaim and a photo op, will strike a quick one and a bad one, not a strong one, not a lasting one" with North Korea, Schumer said.
