The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.The U.S. Africa Command did not immediately comment on the raid. The U.S. has stepped up military efforts against al-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa, under the Trump administration.That stepped-up military involvement, however, has come with some allegations by Somalis that civilians have been killed.People who described themselves as relatives of the people killed in Wednesday's raid expressed bewilderment."They were not armed nor were they al-Shabab members," said Ibrahim Ahmed, who said he was a family member of one man killed."I don't understand why a farm would make a target for a raid," he added, pointing at one of the bloodied bodies that had been laid out on the ground outside a hospital in the capital, Mogadishu.Bodies of civilians, especially those killed in misdirected attacks, often are taken from remote areas to Mogadishu to draw media attention.___AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
