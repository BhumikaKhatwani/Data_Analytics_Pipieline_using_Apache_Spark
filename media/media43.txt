She told police she had fallen asleep while working on a paper.Siyonbola, who said in the videos that the same student had called police months earlier on a friend who had gotten lost in a stairwell of the building, said she saw the statement from Goff-Crews as "a move in the right direction." She said requests for action by the university are currently being drafted by black graduate students.Goff-Crews said administrators and the Yale police chief are planning listening sessions with students in the months ahead to address the episode. She said she also plans to work with administrators and students to review suggestions on how to improve the university's response to incidents of discrimination and harassment.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
