"It's something our team has done a really good job with."Seager added a leadoff shot against Jake Petricka in the fifth, his seventh career multihomer game. Seager's homers were his fifth and sixth of the season."He's a big part of our offense and it's nice when he's going good," manager Scott Servais said.Mariners right-hander Mike Leake (4-3) matched a season high by pitching seven innings. He allowed two runs and six hits."He gave us exactly what we needed tonight," Servais said.Leake said Seager's slam made his job easier."It helps every time," he said. "When you get out to a 4-0 lead in the first it allows you to attack guys a little bit more aggressively."Seager also turned in a great defensive play at third base, a sliding catch in foul territory to retire Yangervis Solarte in the first."Those plays are tough to make, especially coming into the wall," an appreciative Leake said. "He was well aware of where he was and made a nice sliding catch."Ryon Healy and Mike Zunino added solo home runs for Seattle. Healy connected off J.A. Happ in the third, his sixth. Zunino went deep off Tim Mayza in the ninth, his sixth. It was Seattle's fourth four-homer game of the season.The Mariners had 17 hits, matching their season high for a nine-inning game.

"Sometimes less is more."Segura singled and scored in the first, doubled and scored in the second, singled in the fourth and singled again in the seventh. He is 20 for 45 (.444) over his past 10 games against Toronto, dating to 2016.Russell Martin hit a two-run homer for Toronto, but the Blue Jays lost for the sixth time in their past eight home games.
