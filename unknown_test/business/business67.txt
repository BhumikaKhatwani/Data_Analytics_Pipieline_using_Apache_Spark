Euro zone countries have been building a stockpile of cash in the SRM over the last four years but there have long been calls that a backstop would be useful for major emergencies. Gramegna was in Jordan for the EBRD meeting and said the development bank had seen resistance from some of its 66 government shareholders to plans to expand coverage into Sub-Saharan Africa.The EBRD started in 1991 lending to former Soviet countries following the end of the Cold War. Today, it provides finance in over 35 economies."Enlarging or broadening the scope of the EBRD cannot be handled very quickly," Gramegna said. "Our priority would be to strengthen the operations in the existing countries of operation and if there is scope (for expansion), well we can discuss it," he said, also calling for the bank to work with the much larger European Investment Bank.
