We need to take that into account," Kuroda told parliament on Friday."Having said that, there are still some steps remaining that the government needs to take on structural reform and growth strategy," he said, when asked by an opposition lawmaker on how he felt about the government's fiscal and structural policies.In the same parliament session, Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government and the BOJ would work together and deploy "all available measures" to achieve strong growth."I hope the BOJ continues its bold monetary easing and yield curve control to achieve its price target," Aso said.After winning power in 2012, Abe deployed his "Abenomics" brand of reforms consisted of bold monetary easing, fiscal stimulus measures and a growth strategy.While the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures helped weaken the yen and raised corporate profits, many analysts say the government has made little progress on structural reforms.
