These expectations faded after economic data showed increasing evidence of a first-quarter slowdown, as well as remarks from Carney that the data had been "mixed" and the MPC was divided.Nonetheless, sterling fell near to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday after the BoE kept its options open on the timing of future rate rises.Some economists have complained that the BoE has given confusing messages this year, not for the first time."A 7-2 vote against a hike and his reputation as an 'unreliable boyfriend' mean that (Carney)'s going to have to work harder to convince us of the fact that they will get rates above a level they've not passed for almost a decade," analysts at brokerage Hamilton Court FX said on Friday.Broadbent said the message from the BoE in February that interest rates might need to rise somewhat sooner and to a slightly greater extent than markets had expected was explicitly conditional on growth performing in line with BoE forecasts.
